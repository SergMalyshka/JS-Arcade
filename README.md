# <JS arcade>

## Description

Build this tool to practice the skills i have just learned. Ran into a lot of problems duplicating event listeners, restarting the game without refreshing the page, and properly displaying top scores. 

The quiz now properly tracks the amount of questions you answered correctly and time left when you were done, adding two together for competitive nature
